## Software Setup

### Arduino IDE Setup

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (version 2.0+)
2. Install required libraries:
   - Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library
   - Wire library (built-in)

### ESP32 Setup

1. Add ESP32 board support to Arduino IDE
   - File → Preferences → Additional Board Manager URLs
   - Add: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`
2. Install ESP32 board package
3. Install required libraries:
   - Adafruit NeoPixel
   - FastLED (optional, for advanced effects)

### Bottango Setup (Optional - Advanced Animation Control)

[Bottango](https://www.bottango.com/) is a powerful animation software that allows you to create complex, synchronized movements for your animatronic.

1. Download and install Bottango software
2. Connect Arduino via USB
3. Import the provided Bottango file from the original Instructables project
4. Follow Bottango tutorials for creating custom animations

**Alternative**: For RC control, you can use a **Frsky FS-i6X** controller with a 10-channel receiver for direct manual control.

### Visual Studio Code (Optional)

If using VS Code with PlatformIO:

```bash
# Install PlatformIO extension
# Open project folder
# PlatformIO will auto-detect configuration
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allan-stampe/fnaf-cupcake-animatronic.git
cd fnaf-cupcake-animatronic
```

### 2. 3D Print All Parts

- Download STL files from `/3d_models/STL/`
- Print with supports enabled
- Print eye pieces in white PLA with 100% infill
- Estimated print time: 30-50 hours total (depending on printer settings)

### 3. Assemble Mechanical Structure

Follow the detailed assembly guide in `/docs/assembly_guide.md` or refer to the [original Instructables assembly video](https://www.instructables.com/FNAF-Movie-Cupcake-V2-Pre-release/).

Key assembly notes:
- Use the "headhold" piece to attach the head to the eyemech
- Glue the headhold to the top of the head piece
- Slide it over the eyemech middle pole

### 4. Paint and Finish

Follow the painting guide in `/docs/painting_guide.md`:

1. **Sand** all printed parts smooth
2. **Fill gaps** with putty between large parts
3. **Prime** (multiple coats: Prime → Sand → Prime)
4. **Paint inside** parts black
5. **Paint outside** parts with main colors
6. **Detail work** with airbrush for small spots
7. **Mask** carefully to keep lines clean

### 5. Wire Electronics

See `/docs/wiring_diagram.png` for complete wiring instructions.

- Servo shield gets power from external 5V supply
- Arduino connects to same power source
- USB B cable needed for programming/Bottango

### 6. Upload Arduino Code

```bash
# Open arduino/servo_controller/servo_controller.ino in Arduino IDE
# Select Board: Arduino Uno
# Select correct COM port
# Click Upload
```

### 7. Upload ESP32 Code

```bash
# Open esp32/eye_controller/eye_controller.ino in Arduino IDE
# Select Board: ESP32 Dev Module
# Select correct COM port
# Click Upload
```

### 8. Test Servos

Run the servo test sketch to verify all connections:

```bash
# Upload tests/servo_test/servo_test.ino
# Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
# Follow calibration instructions
```

## Features
